# Kubernetes Hardening Student Labs

These labs align with your Kahoot question sets and reinforce hands-on security skills using CIS benchmarks, attack surface minimization, and real-world exploitation awareness.

---

## üîí Lab 1: Evaluate API Server Hardening

**Objective:** Verify `kube-apiserver` flags for CIS compliance and test for unauthenticated access.

### Steps:
1. SSH into your control plane node.
2. Inspect the manifest file:
   ```bash
   cat /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml
   ```
3. Confirm the following flags exist and are set:
   ```bash
   --anonymous-auth=false
   --authorization-mode=RBAC
   --client-ca-file=/etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.crt
   --audit-policy-file=/etc/kubernetes/audit-policy.yaml
   --audit-log-path=/var/log/kubernetes/audit.log
   ```
4. (Exploit) If `--anonymous-auth=true` is set:
   ```bash
   curl -k https://localhost:6443/api
   ```
   Note if the API responds without authentication.

## üßπ Lab 2: Disable Unused Services on a Node

**Objective:** Minimize the OS attack surface.

### Steps:
1. List active services:
   ```bash
   systemctl list-units --type=service
   ```
2. Disable unneeded services:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl disable --now avahi-daemon.service
   sudo systemctl disable --now bluetooth.service
   ```
3. Configure secure kernel parameters:
   ```bash
   echo "net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_redirects = 0" | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.d/99-custom.conf
   echo "net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter = 1" | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.d/99-custom.conf
   sudo sysctl --system
   ```
4. Verify changes:
   ```bash
   sysctl -a | grep 'redirects\|rp_filter'
   ```
5. (Exploit) Run an external `nmap` scan and document unexpected open ports.

## üê≥ Lab 3: Scan for Vulnerabilities Using Trivy

**Objective:** Identify vulnerabilities in container images.

### Steps:
1. Install Trivy:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install -y trivy
   ```
2. Scan an image:
   ```bash
   trivy image nginx:1.19
   ```
3. Document HIGH and CRITICAL findings.
4. (Exploit) If vulnerabilities allow shell access, exploit using known commands (e.g., outdated `wget`, `bash`).

## üìú Lab 4: Deploy and Inspect Audit Logging

**Objective:** Enable and verify Kubernetes audit logs.

### Steps:
1. Create an audit policy YAML:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/kubernetes/audit-policy.yaml
   ```
2. Add flags to the API server manifest (`kube-apiserver.yaml`).
3. Wait for the static pod to reload.
4. Trigger events:
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods
   ```
5. View audit logs:
   ```bash
   sudo tail -f /var/log/kubernetes/audit.log
   ```
6. Identify structure of one audit event.
7. (Exploit) Run:
   ```bash
   kubectl exec -it <pod> -- /bin/sh
   ```
   Then search logs to confirm evidence.

## üõ° Lab 5: Harden the Kubelet

**Objective:** Restrict insecure Kubelet API exposure.

### Steps:
1. Inspect kubelet config file:
   ```bash
   cat /var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml
   ```
2. Set or confirm:
   ```yaml
   readOnlyPort: 0
   authentication:
     anonymous:
       enabled: false
   authorization:
     mode: Webhook
   ```
3. Restart the kubelet:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart kubelet
   ```
4. Verify open ports:
   ```bash
   ss -tuln
   ```
5. (Exploit) If read-only port is open:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:10255/pods
   ```
   Document exposed info.

## üåê Lab 6: Apply NetworkPolicy for Isolation

**Objective:** Apply default deny and allow rules with NetworkPolicy.

### Steps:
1. Deploy two pods in the same namespace.
2. Apply a default deny policy:
   ```yaml
   kind: NetworkPolicy
   spec:
     podSelector: {}
     policyTypes:
       - Ingress
   ```
3. Confirm traffic is blocked.
4. Apply an allow rule:
   ```yaml
   kind: NetworkPolicy
   spec:
     podSelector:
       matchLabels:
         role: backend
     ingress:
       - from:
           - podSelector:
               matchLabels:
                 role: frontend
   ```
5. Confirm frontend can reach backend.
6. (Exploit) Attempt to curl from another pod and verify it is blocked.

These labs are compatible with any Kubernetes distribution (Minikube, kind, RKE2, etc.) and help develop both hardening and threat simulation skills.
